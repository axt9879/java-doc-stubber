Overveiw of project:

user inputs url to java doc class description page AND a destination for the output java class file

the program parses the page and outputs the java class states, constructor and methods as well as their comments to file

TODO list
    Come up with a project name/code name
        Ideas:
            ...

    figure out/learn methods to parse through the html file and gather the java class files
        be sure to analyse multiple java doc webpages to find the common structure

    make functions to out out gathered data to a new class file
        I imagine the function parsing the data would return something like this:
            (['states'], ['constructors'], ['methods'])

        I also image the function that create the new class file to take in a similar tuple as a parameter
